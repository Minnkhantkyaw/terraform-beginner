# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023


## Helping Friends 09/14/23
I kinda like being the one among my friends, who have signed up for the bootcamp, to ask me for 
assistance.  What I'm finding is that they don't listen to me, and not following my directions.

Both are older gentlemen, and well versed in their own areas of IT. Having participated
in the previous bootcamp, getting set up was easy for me, for this bootcamp.  I watched the new 
videos and followed the directions. One friend wanted to use a local development enviromnent.
That's great.  But I won't be assisting him with getting it fixed or issues with his project
if it is cause of not matching the teaching environment.

I also wonder if b/c I am female and younger, that I'm being ignored.
*This is one reason why it's so hard for ladies in IT.* 

No, I don't know everything, **but you asked me for help**; listen to what I have to say/suggest.
Together we'll get this figured out.
