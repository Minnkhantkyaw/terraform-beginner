# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 - Week 1

## Journal TOC and Major Version
We are rearranging our README file and breaking it down into weeks and using a table of contents.

This website will help breakdown our big file and make a TOC easily for us:

###### My Texas Rangers are dropping fly balls!!! :angry:

This will be a major revision and our tag will be 1.0.0, as we are working through week1 videos.

We'll put all the work done in the Readme file in to Week0.md and then start on this next week's documentation in Week1.md (this file).

Made a TOC for the week0 journal and trying to find out why my picutes haven't shown up just yet. 

Then will continue to document this work.
